# japanjournal
A simple MVC Web Application designed for my girlfriend who is travelling to Japan to spend her placement year studying there.
Using Imgur API to strip the images and Azure services to host it all.

## Future Features:
* Responsive design - Especially for iPhone due to Maya having one
* What is Flossy up to page - A comical set of pictures showing Maya's alpaca teddy in different situations
* Add custom domain - something like journal.mayanolan.com
* Possibly add videos? Could do this via youtube links? Similar to the imgur links for photos
* Slicker navigation bar
* Clean the code (especially Javascript)
